Xenko Voxelscape
==============
An open source voxel engine using C# and the Xenko game engine.
Still in the early stages of development and no longer being actively worked on.

This was pulled from LyingDwarf's BitBucket long ago and I attempted to convert to Stride with little success. I am uploading it anyway since the original repo seems to have sadly gone away. https://bitbucket.org/LyingDwarf/xenko-voxelscape/src/master/
